Thanks to github now is possible to host static websites using their service
to see final result of this project with one of available models type
https://stivbanch.github.io  in your browser.

Additional data:
ThreeJS library is pulled from https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/ documentation
from threejs.org is used during project development.

During work I experimented with different tools for converting camera
pictures to 3d objects using different cameras, different Android camera softwares
but with result not good enough to be presented here. Main problem was related to 
inabillity to take pictures which are aligned with software requrements,
simple objects, after editing, was to big for fast and effective results to be
used in browsers on all platforms.

Software list:
Autodesk ReMake and 123D Catch
Models was edited in 3ds Max and Blender.

If you use tablets or smartphones, just tap on screen to see rotation of object...
